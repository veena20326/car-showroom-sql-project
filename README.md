SELECT c.name AS customer_name, ci.model AS car_model FROM Sales s
JOIN Customer c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN Car_Inventory ci ON s.car_id = ci.car_id;

#question4) Display total sales amount handled by each employee.
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales FROM Sales s
JOIN Employee e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY e.name;

#question5. List customers who have availed service and their service cost.
SELECT c.name AS customer_name, sr.service_details, sr.cost FROM Service_Record sr
JOIN Customer c ON sr.customer_id = c.customer_id;

#question6. Find the most expensive car available in stock.
SELECT * FROM Car_Inventory ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 1;

#question7. Count how many cars of each brand are available in stock.
SELECT brand, SUM(stock_quantity) AS total_stock FROM Car_Inventory GROUP BY brand;

JOIN Car_Inventory ci ON s.car_id = ci.car_id
JOIN Employee e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id;
